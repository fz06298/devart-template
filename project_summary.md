## Description
One is the project making a big display through combining many android devices. I'll develop a server program to syncronize devices and an android client application. This project may work in two ways, showing moving dot characters by using each of the android devices as a dot and playing videos on Youtube by dividng into many parts. It'll be fun and beautiful, and people can use this when rooting for their teams.
